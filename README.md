link to project that we intended to do using arduino: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB-F9yLyRm8

i'm doing this step by step 
i have worked with servo and motors individually and they work fine
but when i combine them they are not working properly as it worked individually

problems when i combined the components
1 : one motor is not rotating properly
2 : servo motors are not going to the position that its supposed to be in
3 : servo motor is stuck in its position and making sound as if its trying to change position


send is the main project 
servo_motor and motor_front_back are individual components
